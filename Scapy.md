# Scapy - Python Library for Packet Manipulation

Scapy is a powerful Python library used for packet crafting, manipulation, and network analysis. It enables users to create custom packets, send and receive them, and analyze their behavior. It is a versatile tool widely used in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and network engineering.

## Features
- **Packet Crafting**: Create and customize network packets.
- **Packet Sniffing**: Capture live network traffic.
- **Protocol Support**: Works with various protocols like Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, and many more.
- **Network Analysis**: Analyze and manipulate packets for in-depth testing.
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrate with other tools or scripts.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.6 or above installed, then use the following command to install Scapy:
```bash
pip install scapy
```

## Getting Started
### Import Scapy
```python
from scapy.all import *
```

### Crafting and Sending Packets
Send an ICMP echo request (ping):
```python
packet = IP(dst="8.8.8.8")/ICMP()
send(packet)
```

### Capturing Packets
Sniff packets on the network:
```python
def packet_callback(packet):
    print(packet.summary())

sniff(filter="ip", prn=packet_callback, count=5)
```

### Displaying Packet Details
Decode and inspect packet layers:
```python
packet = IP(dst="8.8.8.8")/ICMP()
packet.show()
```

## Common Use Cases
1. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Simulate and analyze attacks such as ARP spoofing or DoS.
2. **Network Diagnostics**:
   - Test firewall rules or router configurations.
3. **Education and Research**:
   - Learn about network protocols and packet behavior.
